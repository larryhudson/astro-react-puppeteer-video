## To do list

- [x] Rather than having 'start' and 'end', what about just duration? And then we work out what the current slide is based on the current time
- Thinking about slide animations - fade in and fade out
- [x] Animations within a slide shouldn't be dependent on the 'global video time' - they should be dependent on the slide time
- Need a way of telling Puppeteer that the map slide is ready for action
- Need a way of telling Puppeteer that the frame content has not changed, so use the same screenshot as the last frame. Some concept of 'clean' and 'dirty'
- MDX slides? Write content as Markdown?

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
